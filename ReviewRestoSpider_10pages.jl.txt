This restaurant is a student-led commercially-run restaurant designed to deepen the experience of the 16+ year old students at the Orpington Career College focused on the Hospitality and Food industries. Not everything ran completely smoothly, nor did we expect it to. The advertised sauce b\u00e9arnaise did not turn up with the steak, because the b\u00e9arnaise had broken while it was being made - that is the risk you run when students are running the kitchen (shown on the CCTV screen behind us) and when dishes are cooked from scratch. The warm chocolate brownie was tepid at most. However my wife reports it was quite delicious, and my own rump of lamb with red cabbage, potatoes and a parsnip cream was excellent. Indeed the red cabbage was the best I have ever eaten. My glass of Malbec accompanied the lamb brilliantly. This is not a restaurant for those in a hurry; we expected to spent two hours on lunch, and did.

The bluetooth connection for the music kept buffering. Nice staff who tried hard with the service and were friendly, but no, I wont be recommending or going back, sorry.", "name": "Geocacher1973", "title": "An off night for Annabellas", "Restaurant_name": [" Anabella's Kitchen "], "Rating": ["2 of 5 bubbles"]}

We'll, the food was so disappointing. The selection of food, in particular the mains buffet, was poor. The roast beef was burnt to a crisp. The lamb tasted of...I'm not sure what it tasted of but it certainly didn't taste of lamb. No one had the chicken so I can't comment on that. Probably the best section was the starters buffet. Quite a comprehensive selection. The desserts were pretty average. The custard was like water ! I was, like all the guests at the table, very disappointed in the quality of the food and for sure will not be returning here. The price you pay for this buffet is not cheap and therefore you expect something much better than what you'd get at the Toby Carvery.! . The service was probably the only good thing.

The service not very pleasant as not a single waitress smiled. It was a while before we got our main courses. The food was ok but my cheese garlic bread was disappointing. The bread was slightly burnt and too crispy and the cheese dip was separate. This soon solidified. Pointless!

{"partial content": "Visited this restaurant a lot over the years and used to be top food. But last 2 visits the meat dishes have been inedible. 1 was lamb, so fatty that I struggled to find the meat and 2nd was a beef Wellington. As we all know it comes up medium/rare so you should be able to cut through with ease. But it was impossible to get a knife through it, it was full of muscle and had to leave it. When we said the meat was tough, there wasnt a sorry, just took the plate away and we saw the waitress take to kitchen and try cutting it, as if we were lying. So we decided on that note that we wont be visiting again. I also agree with the coldness of the restaurant, if you sit to the left of the bar you get a draft from the door out the back that gets opened for supplies and fag breaks and sometimes left wedged open by the staff (nr toilets). Then if you sit in the line of the main door, then you have no chance of getting warm with the flow of people in and out. It's a shame as I used to love this little restaurant. The service needs to up its game, otherwise risk losing a lot of business, I'm afraid you cant sit back and expect people to still come if the food is also lacking quality.", "name": "jamiewS6318NE", "title": "Food (meat) quality gone downhill", "Restaurant_name": [" Chupitos Tapas Bar and Restaurant "], "Rating": ["2 of 5 bubbles"]}

Last Sunday I ordered food as my friends were visiting and even before I asked they asked me when my friends were arriving as they wanted to prepare hot food close to the time they were arriving. This made me feel that they definitely know the needs of the customer.

Nevertheless, it was the closest and as we had a 2 year old in our group, did not want to venture far. There were 6 (including the 2 year old) of us and we had booked in advance. We went into the restaurant and were seated by a staff member. We were looking through the menu when the big guy with glasses (who I think is one of the owners) came by and rudely asked us to get up. We were surprised and my husband questioned the need for this, he very abruptly said that he will move the table to a corner as he wanted to rearrange the seating so that he can include seating for 2 people, where we were sitting. We were confused as there was clearly a 2 seater at the corner- but no he wanted the 6 of us to get up so that he can rearrange the table for the white couple (obviously this wasnt mentioned, but we noticed this after we ordered when the couple walked in) who would be coming in soon. We should have got up and left at that moment but the staff member who sat us initially was very apologetic and we ordered. We spend close to 100 pounds in the evening and even paid service charge. I was reluctant but my husband said he would rather pay as that goes to the staff (hopefully!) and he wouldnt fault the staff. The food was mediocre but nothing to complain. It was the whole experience of being ask to rudely get up and move for a white couple, after we had sat down and made ourselves comfortable, that sullied the experience. This was when there was a perfectly good spot for a couple seat at the corner. Furthermore, being racist and rude does not help. We are frequent restaurant goers but we wouldnt be darkening their doors again.

{"partial content": "Recently visited this restaurant for the first time. We were the first customers there having arrived at 18:00 when they first opened for the evening. A waiter appeared from behind the counter and went to check with an older gentleman for available tables (we hadn\u2019t booked), the waiter was just handed a phone by the gentleman and told to take an order so we were left standing in an empty restaurant for a few minutes wondering what to do. Finally we were seated in the middle of the restaurant but we asked to move which they were fine with but it was made clear other tables were booked. Another couple arrived soon after us also without booking and it was touch and go wether there were any tables available for them, they also had it made clear that other tables had been booked, they were eventually seated next to us. Very soon the restaurant was nearly full and there was a delay getting our order taken, eventually we placed our order. Food was very good indeed, I asked for mine to be slightly more Spicey than the standard but my curry eating all over the world must\u2019ve dulled my sense of spice so I should have asked for even more. Rice tasted nice and fresh and not left over from the lunch time like some restaurants might do. It was hard to get someone\u2019s attention to ask for the bill but eventually it came. The 10% optional service charge is clearly shown on the bill and although we didn\u2019t mind paying the full 10%, there was a mistake in our change but the young waitress candidly admitted to being \u201crubbish at maths\u201d (and clearly she was) so this made the whole paying experience more painful than was necessary. To summarise, it\u2019s best to book, food is good, the young waiters all seem to try hard but it\u2019s clear they are all either very new to the industry or need more instruction and guidance, as does the older gentleman who might be the owner and may be best suited back of house.", "name": "Travellerplus1", "title": "Very good food.", "Restaurant_name": [" Masala Dabbas "], "Rating": ["3 of 5 bubbles"]}

{"partial content": "Ten of us visited on a Saturday night a few weeks before Christmas. Thought it would be nice to meet in the bar 30 minutes ahead of our table booking for a drink. Sadly this wasn't possible. 80% of the bar area was sectioned off for a private party and the other 20% was completely full. Fortunately our table was ready so we sat down for dinner early. There was nowhere to leave coats. To quote our waitress ' there is a cloakroom but its already full' - this was 7pm! One member of our party was due to arrive late due to work commitments - when 9 of us sat down it was quite clear from the table we had been allocated that it would not be possible to make space of our 10th member to join us. We were served our drinks after a 30 minute wait. We had been asked to pre-order food so there should really have been a delay. Before our starters arrived we were all asked to shuffle down to the next table which we duly did and where there was enough space. Starters arrived - they were very good but we were all starving after the long wait. Another party of 10 had arrived at the restaurant - they were allocated the table we had moved from. Guess what? Also not big enough for them. There were 2 ladies dining at the end of our row of tables and the staff were hurrying them out so we could move down yet again to accommodate the other table of 10. So much of a hurry that we were asked to move half way through eating our starters so the other party could all be seated - the 2 ladies spent \u00a341 and I wonder if it was worth the restaurant taking this booking at the expense of upsetting 20 other diners? The rest of our evening was uneventful - except for the party of around 20 drunk ladies singing loudly! The food was excellent but our evening was marred by the musical tables escapades and the slow service. This restaurant is missing a trick - had the service, particularly for drinks, been better we would have spent more.

Mains were even better, Perfectly cooked Lemon Sole with an etuvee of leeks in a Chive and Gewurztraminer sauce was excellent as was Guinea Fowl again with leeks and what was described on the menu as crispy potato. This description did not do them justice. I would describe them as like fondant potato cooked and cut into 3 cm cubes and then each side seared, the end result being like small mouthfulsof perfect roast potato.We finished with a really enjoyable rum roasted pineapple and chocolate marquis.

There are about 6 of 4 seat tables out the front all a maximum 5 yards from the door. I went inside, which is nice, ordered two pints and shortly after went back in and ordered a sandwich. I was told they would not serve food outside as it was too busy...no queue at the bar and did not seem overly busy to me. I asked if they could serve it to the bar and I would pick it up...no was the answer. I then asked if I could order to a table and then take it outside...answer was yes but then only if I sat at the table until it was served. A bit bizarre to block a table and have me in whilst my wife was outside. We then nicely asked a couple of people if they would receive the sandwich and we would then get it from them...no problem here I thought. All good and paid for. 10 minutes later the manager arrived with a refund saying the people inside could not have the sandwiches as they had already ordered and they could not have any more food! I actually thought he was joking. He could have brought out the food in this time. As we sat there wondering what was happening we saw two other tables refused food outside. They seemed to be now spending more time saying they could not serve food than just serve food. How many pubs get a chance to serve lunch time sandwiches on 30 December outside to tables 5 yards from the front door and turn it down? Very bizarre, cannot be someone driven by financial return. Gets 2 stars as the beer is nice but forget about ordering food and cannot see myself going back again to face such comical customer service.

There is also a car park around the back which was also a bonus.

We were just going to have Pizza, but the choice of starters and ant-pasti in the well appointed menu, \u2018forced us\u2019 to have the pan fried chicken livers to start, which were mouth-wateringly tasty, on fresh mixed leaves, balsamic dressing and with thin and light as a feather pizza bread. The Pizzas we had were obviously prepared and cooked by experts. The dough was tasty all on its own with the very fresh toppings just the right amount with each slice. The 3 sizes of pizza on offer, meant that sharing different types of pizza added to the enjoyment. Will definitely be back and next time opt for a main course proper and not Pizza; not because the Pizza was not good, in fact we hoovered up every last crumb...... but because the dishes being waitered past our table to other dinners, looked and wafted a whole host of glorious smells.

The mains came I had the grilled Salmon... Over cooked dry salmon with no flavour. The waiter did not even ask why more than half was still on my plate when he took it away. My friend ordered the salmon with tomato sauce and cheese... It was just mush she too left most of it. Have to say the one person who had lamb was satisfied.

The staff were very courteous and nothing was of no bother , very attentive .

We ordered our drinks and were asked if we were ready to order in which we replied please can we have a few minutes, after being asked another two times we ordered our starters only, another three or times after that they were pressuring us to order our mains to which I replied can we order it about 9.10pm (the time was 8.40pm) as we wanted a rest. The waiter then said we close at 11pm so ordering just after 9pm would have given us plenty of time, but no they wouldn\u2019t allow this and another waiter came over and insisted on taking our order. The food was lovely. We had desert while the staff stood there starring at us making it obvious they wanted us out of the restaurant so they can close making us feel extremely uncomfortable. Then my friend needed the loo but couldn\u2019t get in there because a male member of staff was using the ladies loo again, I challenged them and said it\u2019s probably not the right thing that customers have to wait while the staff use the ladies loo and for some reason they found this funny.

We chose a bottle of wine and my husband had a bottle of beer to start after we chose our drinks the manager brought the food menu again giving us plenty of time to look at the menu plus he showed us the specials board. The menu has a great variety especially as I eat mainly fish but even I was tempted by the meat dishes which I will try next time I visit. The portions are big my starter of fried cheese was lovely and I could have shared it easily between two but my husband does not eat cheese. He asked for a pasta dish for a starter which they had no problem doing for him. I had the plaice new potatoes and french beans for my main again this was big but it was so good my husband had a well done steak with saut\u00e9 potatoes and french beans, we asked for soft veg and a different sauce from the menu for the steak. There was no problem changing the menu to suit our tastes nothing was too much trouble. The waitress also very friendly brought us the dessert menu my husband had a fantastic apple pie and cream I had a lovely chocolate mousse cake with a drambuie.

{"partial content": "It was my sister's birthday on Tuesday, and three of us descended on Capricho on a wet and blustery evening. The bifolding doors welcome you into a warm haven of hanging and recessed lighting with a modern-ish decor. There is a small bar with seats on the left of the entrance.We have now known Marta, Carlos, and their brilliant team for some time now - since they first opened - and their friendliness and professionalism has never wavered. We were greeted by customary warmth by Marta and Ana then shown to our table. To the accompaniment of lovely background music, and armed with Jungel and Capirao cocktails, we perused their varied menu; it's a menu that has a good mix of fish, seafood, meats, and pasta dishes that should suit most palates. We soon made our selection. Our starters were Pica Pau, which is cubed tuna on a bed of sweet potatoes with peppers; Gambas whisky, which is grilled prawns in a whisky-garlic sauce; Gambas Pimenta, which is spicy grilled prawns; all were prepared to perfection in texture and taste, and were devoured within seconds. Then Carlos joined us and it was great seeing him. Our mains consisted of Arroz de Tamboril, which is monkfish, clams, and prawns in rice with a rich garlic sauce and peppers; fillets De Dourad, which is seabass and trimmings; a five meat mixed grill; again, all the dishes were rich in flavour and had us all salivating - it's amazing we didn't get arrested! This culinary splendour was baptised with a lovely Casal Garcia: a light Portuguese white with a hint of sparkle that complemented our meal wonderfully. Our gastronomic debauchery wasn't over and we found room for a rich chocolate mousse and, for the birthday girl, an Obidos with a lighted candle and Marta and Ana singing 'Happy Birthday'. Obrigado. The birthday girl then had a Ginginha. We concluded this happy feast with Castanha liqueuers and a Tia Maria with a cappuccino, black Americano, and a lemon tea. Plus complimentary ones from our gracious hosts. Muito 'brigado. As always, it's not just the great food and professional service that sets this splendid eatery apart, but it's the atmosphere of friendship, laughter, banter, and chat that elevates your dining experience to an unforgettable moment in time. A huge thank you to the talented chefs, and to Marta, Carlos, and Ana for a wonderful time.

The feeling on arriving at Leila's does make you think you are in for something special but I have to say that although the food was ok it wasn't anything special by a long shot. Bread was uninspiring and the cold Meze starter was lacking flavour and just seemed to be of poor cheap quality. Even the mayonnaise was tasteless and watery! Service wasn't brilliant given that they weren't busy and needed a fair bit of prompting. The mixed kebab meats also lacked flavour and felt like they had been dusted in a spice mix rather then any marinating going on.

{"partial content": "Yet another fabulous lunch at La Dolce Vita. I started the New Year determined to break out of my habits and try doing something different. So although we decided to go to one of our favourite places for lunch I did choose something different on the menu, which is also a new addition. The tagliatalle vongole with pistachio chilli and garlic. I think this is a southern Italian/Sicilian speciality. It may seem an odd combination but it is divinely moreish. I used to have the boar ragu which is also delicious but a craving for seafood usually means you need something it offers. The clams were plump and meaty and melt in the mouth and the combination of flavours perfect. My family loved their pasta with swordfish and seafood special, the corn fed chicken with mushrooms, huge thin real italian pizza and we started with perfect calamari and prawns - not greasy or chewy but crisp and perfectly cooked. Bread and olives are also complimentary unlike some places which sadly overcharge for this. House wine is fine. As ever Maurizio is the perfect host and you cannot get a warmer welcome.
